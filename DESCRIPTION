Description: Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that
    allows for the transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with
    minimal framing overhead â€“ just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does
    not specify an encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data
    serialization format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers,
    XML, JSON, MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
    transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
    AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data at
    rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried over
    an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine how to
    interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
